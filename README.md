# PMB_v5_Beta_7_28
 A Valorant Scoreboard Project and Stream Package

This is a beta of v5. This is not meant to be directly used for streaming yet and is instead of large teaser of what is to come...

This is a warning that not everything in the beta is entirely working and some issues are expected. If you notice anything please lmk in the discord in #Beta-feedback

This Read me will be updated much more for future beta releases and updates.
